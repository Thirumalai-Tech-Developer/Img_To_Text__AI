# 📊 Candlestick Image-to-Text Model

Welcome to the Candlestick Image-to-Text Model repository! This project uses a fine-tuned BLIP model to analyze candlestick charts and generate descriptive text predictions based on historical trading data. 🕹️

## 🎯 Purpose
The model is built to analyze and interpret candlestick images for potential trading insights, using an image-to-text framework.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **model**: Contains model loading and training scripts.
  - `LoadModel/Load_Model.py` - Handles model initialization and loading.
- **PreProcess**: Data preprocessing modules.
  - `PreProcess/Change_RGB.py` - Converts candlestick images to RGB format.
  - `PreProcess/Load_Data.py` - Loads and prepares data for training.
- **Train**: Model training pipeline.
  - `Train/Train.py` - Core training loop to train the model on the dataset.
  
## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Imgtotext_Architecture.git
   cd Imgtotext_Architecture
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pretrained Model**
   This project uses a pretrained [BLIP model](https://huggingface.co/) from Hugging Face.
   ```python
   from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
   model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("your-huggingface-model")
   processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("your-huggingface-model")
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Model
1. **Prepare the Data**
   - Organize your CSV files and images as per the dataset structure defined in `PreProcess/Load_Data.py`.
   
2. **Train the Model**
   - Run the following script to start training:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - **Explanation of `main.py`:**
      - Loads the model.
      - Preprocesses candlestick images.
      - Loads training data.
      - Starts the training loop.

3. **Example Prediction**
   After training, you can use the model to generate predictions on new candlestick images.

### 📑 Sample Code for Prediction
```python
from PIL import Image
import torch

# Load model and processor
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("your-huggingface-model")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("your-huggingface-model").to("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Prepare the image
image = Image.open("path_to_your_candlestick_image.jpg").convert("RGB")
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

# Generate prediction
output = model.generate(**inputs)
print(processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## 🧩 File Descriptions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Executes the full pipeline: loading model, preprocessing, training |
| `Load_Model.py` | Model loading script for initializing and loading pretrained weights |
| `Change_RGB.py` | Converts candlestick images to RGB format for compatibility |
